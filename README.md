## About

DiagnoEase is a web application developed for Empire General Hospital to assist
patients with self-diagnosis of many diseases through the usage of AI. While
this application does not meet the accuracy, care, and consideration that a
trained medical professional would (nor is it meant to), this application is
meant to improve patient-doctor communications by having patients report what
symptoms they are currently experiencing, and what top-5 diseases they could be
ailing from. Furthermore, as telehealth and remote healthcare options become
more available, it is expected that AI will play a crucial role in identifying
patient prognoses. Thus, it is critical that the AI infrastructure and
applications (such as this prototype) exist in order to test the efficacy of
such solutions.
